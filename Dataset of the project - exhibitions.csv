Marking Peru's bicentennial year of independence, this exhibition highlighted the history, beliefs and cultural achievements of the different peoples who lived here from around 2500 BC to the arrival of Europeans in the 1500s, and their legacy in the centuries that followed. From Peru's early indigenous peoples to the ill-fated Inca, this exhibition explored how past cultures were shaped by the diverse landscapes of the central Andes, flourishing at some of the highest altitudes and in some of the driest deserts on earth. Visitors discovered how they developed unique approaches to time, agriculture, economy and power, some of which endure today. The exhibition featured objects from the British Museum's collection, including pottery, precious metals, textiles and ritual paraphernalia, as well as extraordinary pieces borrowed from Peru itself. Striking, large-scale photography and videos of iconic sites, including the Nasca geoglyphs and Machu Picchu, also gave visitors a vivid sense of place and an appreciation of the artistic and architectural prowess of ancient Andean cultures.",,Museo de Arte de Lima,PROMPERÚ,https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/peru-journey-time?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=blog&utm_term=1&utm_content=link_18/10/2021_mktg,"ceramics, precious metals, textiles, ritual objects","metal, textile, stone, wood, clay","cooking, storing food and water, decorative, spiritual",offline,TRUE

We could only glimpse into this hidden world, until the discovery of the Rosetta Stone provided the key to decoding hieroglyphs, allowing us to read this ancient script. The breakthrough expanded our understanding of human history by some 3,000 years.
Marking 200 years since the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs, this major exhibition takes you through the trials and hard work that preceded, and the revelations that followed, this ground-breaking moment.
Hieroglyphs were not just beautiful symbols, they represented a living, spoken language. From romantic poetry and international treaties, to shopping lists and tax returns, the hieroglyphic inscriptions and ancient handwriting in this exhibition reveal stories that are fantastically varied. As well as an unshakeable belief in the power of the pharaohs and the promise of the afterlife, ancient Egyptians enjoyed good food, writing letters and making jokes.
The show will chart the race to decipherment, from initial efforts by medieval Arab travellers and Renaissance scholars to more focussed progress by French scholar Jean-François Champollion (1790–1832) and England’s Thomas Young (1773–1829). The Rosetta Stone, discovered in 1799, with its decree written in hieroglyphs, demotic and the known language of ancient Greek, provided the key to decoding the ancient signs. The results of the 1822 breakthrough proved staggering.
Using inscriptions on the very objects that Champollion and other scholars studied, this immersive exhibition will help you to unlock one of the world’s oldest civilisations.",,,British Petroleum,https://www.britishmuseum.org/exhibitions/hieroglyphs-unlocking-ancient-egypt,texts,stone,"commemoration, communication ",offline,TRUE

Made from the remnants of a refugee boat wrecked near the Italian island of Lampedusa, the cross carries messages about kindness, community and the indifference faced by many refugees. In October 2013, an overcrowded boat carrying migrants from Somalia and Eritrea caught fire, capsized and sank near Lampedusa, close to the coast of Tunisia. 311 lives, fleeing persecution and seeking refuge in Europe, were lost. Moved by the plight of survivors, the island's carpenter, Francesco Tuccio, made crosses from the wreckage. These signified salvation from the sea, hope for the future and as well as the sad fate of many migrants.
Alongside the cross will be a display of 12 tiny boats from Syrian-born Issam Kourbaj's series Dark Water, Burning World. Made from repurposed bicycle mudguards tightly packed with burnt matches, the artwork represents the fragile vessels used by refugees to make their perilous voyages as a response to the ongoing tragedy in Syria. The boats convey the fear and exhaustion of the crossing, and the trepidatious uncertainty of survival. In utilising cheap and discarded materials that might otherwise go to waste as the basis for the artwork, Kourbaj represents the need for refugees to use what they can freely acquire following separation from their homeland, while urging the global community to find value in everything and everyone, no matter how humble their origins.
The Lampedusa disaster was one of the first examples of the European migrant crisis and the terrible tragedies that have befallen refugees and migrants as they seek to cross from unstable regions in Africa and the Middle East into Europe. It marks an extraordinary moment in European history and stands witness to the kindness of the people of Lampedusa and as a reference to the ongoing migrant plight today.
The tour will touch on the ethical and practical challenges presented by mass movements of people, and on how Europe has recently responded to refugees and migrants. The Lampedusa cross will be displayed in Coventry and then the Spotlight Loan will tour to venues in Manchester, Hastings, Derby, Ipswich, Bristol, Rochester and Dorchester from May 2021 – February 2023 as part of the British Museum's National Programmes, bringing objects from the Museum to audiences around the UK for free.",,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/our-work/national/uk-touring-exhibitions-and-loans/current-tours/crossings-community-and-refuge,ritual objects,"stone, wood",spiritual ,offline,TRUE

The blast killed at least 218 people, injured 7,000 and displaced 300,000 as well as causing $15bn of damage. The immediate and lasting effects have been deeply traumatic, not just for Beirut's citizens but for all Lebanese people.
Just over 3km from the epicentre, at the Archaeological Museum at the American University of Beirut(Opens in new window) (AUB), a case displaying 74 glass vessels was destroyed, the shards of ancient glass mixing with those from the case and surrounding windows, seemingly inextricable. The story of the restoration of eight of these vessels is a powerful expression of the grief, solidarity and recovery of the people of Lebanon. A collaboration between the AUB and the British Museum, the journey of these shattered vessels has seen them transported to the Museum’s world-class conservation centre and, piece by piece, put together again.
Staff from the Archaeological Museum have worked with British Museum conservators for three months and the eight vessels, which are mainly Roman with a few Byzantine and Islamic examples, are now whole again. The conservation process saw the fragments carefully and laboriously sorted and the individual vessels sensitively and painstakingly reconstructed. The team purposefully made the joins between the shards visible and, though some of the missing areas were filled to support the surrounding fragments, others were left unfilled. These visible scars and missing fragments bear witness to the explosion and the determination of the people of Lebanon to recover.
Ranging from the first to the ninth century, the bowls, flask, beaker, jug and cup in this display collectively spoke of the rich cultural heritage of the wider region – and they told new stories through the scars they bear.

'Multaka-Oxford' is a collaborative project involving the Pitt Rivers Museum, the History of Science Museum, community partners and volunteers. Funded by the Esmée Fairbairn Collections Fund, 'Multaka-Oxford' is about integration, inclusivity and shared cultures. The project has created new volunteer roles in these museums, particularly for people who have recently arrived in Oxford.
Since April 2018, staff and volunteers have been developing news ways for museums and their collections to be used by people to build practical skills, connect with others, learn and share stories. The museums have benefitted greatly from giving space to diverse voices and, by listening, have gained new insights into their collections.
The Collection: Textiles from the Arab World
'Multaka' volunteers at the Pitt Rivers Museum have worked closely with staff to add new perspectives to a collection of textiles, recently donated by Dr Jenny Balfour-Paul. Jenny is a researcher, collector of worldwide textiles and a renowned expert on indigo dye. In 2016, she offered the Museum a selection of textiles purchased during her travels around the Middle East and North Africa during the 1970s and 1980s.
The Display: Intercultural Interpretation
This display was produced by five volunteers from different countries, with diverse backgrounds and perspectives. The aim is to highlight how museums can be a meeting point for people to share their cultures, experiences and interests, and to tell important stories.
The collaborators have selected objects from the Jenny Balfour-Paul collection, as well as photographs and personal items, and have each produced a set of personalised captions. The connections between these individual narratives reveal the common threads human beings share.

14,GB,PR,exhibition,31 Aug 2018,25 Jan 2019,2018,2019,Central Asia,Tibet,Tibetan Objects in Transition,material culture of Tibet,,"The material culture of Tibet has been sought, collected and studied in the West since the middle of the nineteenth century. Often construed as valuable and exotic ‘art’ or ‘antiques’, it has since entered museum collections and art markets in large quantities. British museum collections of Tibetan material expanded greatly in the early twentieth century following the extensive looting that occurred during the Younghusband ‘Mission’ to Tibet of 1903–4. Thereafter, anthropologists, missionaries, explorers and other visitors to Tibet continued the process of removing items they believed could explain its mysteries and its religion. Thousands of Tibetan objects are therefore now stored in museums around the world, but Tibetans often lack access to them and the opportunity to interpret them in their own terms. The display Tibetan Objects in Transition arose from the perceived need to insert contemporary Tibetan voices, narratives and perspectives into museum space(s).
This case display is an experiment in creating a ‘Tibetan’ mode of displaying material culture which emphasises contemporary Tibetan voices, narratives and perspectives. Drawing from the Pitt Rivers Museum’s collections, as well as objects loaned by members of the Tibetan community in the UK, it is underpinned by the idea of transition, in terms of the material culture and people of Tibet. Like some Tibetan people, Tibetan objects have been ‘displaced’ from their original settings and acquired new meanings over the course of their journeys. Here, these displaced objects and narratives have been reunited with Tibet, personified through the figure of Senmo.
Senmo, the Supine Demoness of Tibet
The image underpinning this display depicts the Senmo – a traditional female representation of the Tibetan landscape. She is depicted pinned down by Buddhist temples at thirteen key locations on her body: four in the inner realm (shoulders and hips), four at the border areas (knees and elbows), four at the borders beyond (hands and feet), and one at the centre (heart). For Tibetans, this geomantic map symbolizes the superimposition of Buddhism over the demoness’s power. The image also relates to shifts in Tibetan political organisation, from a loose tribal confederacy to a large and sophisticated empire that spread into Central Asia during the Yarlung Dynasty in the seventh to ninth centuries CE.",,"Tibetan community in the UK, Clare Harris",,https://prm.web.ox.ac.uk/event/tibetan-objects-in-transition,"national crafts, ritual objects","stone, metal, clay","spiritual, practical",offline,TRUE

Messy Realities: The Secret Life of Technology explored the work of the research project Studies in Co-Creating Assisted Living Solutions (SCALS). The SCALS team invited museum engagement staff and members of the public to co-design a display that would reflect on the team’s research into assistive living technologies and generate new insights to inform ongoing research. This process brought together an interdisciplinary group of researchers, museum staff, designers from Rycotewood Furniture Centre and community members living with long-term health conditions to test connections between historic museum objects and contemporary medical technologies, particularly ‘assistive living technologies’. If we put unexpected objects together, could meaningful connections be made? Could we spark new ideas about what assistive living technologies are and find out new things about what they mean to the people who use them? Could we think about objects in the collections in new ways by viewing them alongside assistive living technologies from the SCALS research?
A museum of comparative technology meets assistive living technology
Often described as a ‘museum of comparative technology’, the Pitt Rivers collections can be understood as worldwide examples of technologies created to cope with the dilemmas of life. For example, it demonstrates ways to stay connected with loved ones, ways to worship and ways to care for family. To develop the Messy Realities display, we thought about objects in the collections as technologies that assist people to live their lives, just like the assistive living technologies from the SCALS research that we considered alongside them.
As part of the display, we grouped Museum items with technologies from the SCALS research to create new meanings and make connections. In the two images below you can see a digital alarm designed for the user to wear around the neck to summon help, for example after a fall, next to an object from the Museum’s handling collection. In the first image, you can see a leather neck ornament (likely from Nigeria) and in the second, an arrowhead (UK). Both the leather ornament and the arrowhead would have been worn or held close to the body as protective amulets, helping their owner to feel safe. The SCALS research found that pendant alarms can take on amuletic meaning, with some people wearing them to feel safe while out, even though they know they do not work out of range of their house.
Containers were another type of object group we explored. We grouped together different types of containers used to hold ‘medicine’, and discussed what they brought to mind. Dosset boxes can be pre-prepared by pharmacists or filled by the user at home, but are often replaced with Tupperware or other containers better suited to the person using them. For example, we displayed the hollow shell of a nut from Uttar Pradesh Mirzapur (India) collected from a local ‘drug seller and surgeon’, and a gilt metal box (or ‘inro’) from Japan decorated with lacquer varnish, with the attached wooden netsuke and ivory model of a house. The nut shell, Tupperware (UK) and dosset boxes (UK) are functional and plain, with no intrinsic monetary value. In comparison, the decorative inro can indicate wealth and status. This object grouping stimulated interesting discussions with the co-curators about assistive living technologies, value, status and stigma.",,,"Rycotewood Furniture Centre, David Walker (Phillips), Stephanie Bevan (Herts Careline),

In this exhibition, Shah explores very personal themes linked to his family’s roots and heritage as Ugandan Asians, and offers wider narratives around exile, displacement and dispossession.
In the years following World War II, Africa witnessed a prolonged struggle for liberation and independence leading to its gradual decolonisation. Although this gave greater political power to African leaders across the continent, it was not the end of political instability, and social suffering for many citizens in various African nations continued.
In August 1972, almost a decade after Britain’s colonial withdrawal from Uganda, Idi Amin (1925–2003), President of Uganda from 1971 to 1979, made a decree to expel the entire Asian population from Uganda, amounting to approximately 80,000 people. He accused them of monopolising the economy and not integrating with indigenous Ugandans.
As a former British colony, Uganda, similar to other sub-Saharan colonies, had many citizens of South Asian descent.

Woodthorpe Collection,,"This exhibition presents a selection of material from the Pitt Rivers Museum’s R. G. Woodthorpe collection, much of which has never before been on public view. The display case contains writings, sketched and photographic images, and objects produced and collected in the Naga Hills region of northeast India during the 1870s. These diverse items offer an insight into how British colonial officials understood and represented their interactions with ‘frontier tribes’, as they termed the inhabitants of the Naga Hills and other upland areas on India’s fringes.
The creator or collector of the items on display was Robert Gosset Woodthorpe (1844–1898), a British army officer in the Royal Engineers. He took a posting to India in 1869 and from 1871 worked for the Survey of India, engaged primarily in mapping frontier regions of Britain’s empire. Along with stints in the Naga Hills, Woodthorpe undertook survey work in upland areas to the east of Bengal, to the north of Assam, and in northern Burma. He also accompanied British military columns into India’s north-west frontier during the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–1880) and during an expedition north of Kashmir in the mid-1880s. In the course of these surveys, Woodthorpe kept diaries and prolifically sketched landscapes and people. He became renowned as an expert on India’s frontiers, giving talks on his travels to prestigious London-based learned institutions, including the Royal Geographical Society and the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. In the final decade of his life, Woodthorpe rose to senior positions in British India’s knowledge-gathering establishment, eventually becoming second-in-command of the Survey of India.
The Naga Hills to the south of the Assam Valley was the region that Woodthorpe depicted most intensively. His survey work there took place in the mid-1870s, when the British colonial state sought to expand its control over a previously ungoverned and little-known area of narrow valleys and jagged mountain ridges. Colonial stereotypes of the numerous fragmented communities known as ‘Nagas’ that inhabited the region were already in circulation before Woodthorpe’s time. These pejorative representations emphasised the exotic appearance and violent tendencies of the people. Many of the images, written descriptions, and objects in the Woodthorpe collection built on and further embedded these reductive assumptions of ‘tribal’ culture. However, Woodthorpe’s materials were also the products of more intensive and sustained encounters between British colonial personnel and Naga individuals and groups than had taken place previously. The items of clothing, sketches, writings, and photographs displayed in this case reflect the complexities of these encounters, in which intimacy and violence intermingled, impacting both coloniser and colonised.",,"Rebecca Ash, RJA Mountmaking","Ian Cartwright, Nicholas Crowe",https://prm.web.ox.ac.uk/event/surveying-the-nagas,"texts, visual art","paper, paints, graphite",communication,offline,TRUE

Although the two skirts were made more than fifty years apart, they are stylistically similar, demonstrating a continuation in Iraqw leatherwork and beadwork traditions. Such skirts are worn wrapped around a woman’s waist. The combination of the thick hide and the numerous beads make the skirts extremely heavy, some examples weighing as much as 15 kilograms.
Iraqw skirts are amongst the most elaborately decorated textiles from eastern Africa. Each skirt is unique, the design being a product of the skill of the individual maker and the resources available. Typically, the skirts consist of four panels made from cow- or goat-hide, with thousands of beads attached using lazy stitch to create the characteristic long bands and geometric motifs. In historic examples, the beads are usually white, red, blue and black, with some yellow; those made in later decades incorporate other colours, such as light blue and green. Although a number of anthropologists have attempted to understand the significance of the colours and symbolism of the motifs, any precise meanings they may have remain unknown to outsiders.
The skirts were made by young girls as part of the Iraqw women’s initiation ritual known as Marmo. Through participation in Marmo, Iraqw girls transitioned from puberty to womanhood. During the ceremony, girls were secluded from the wider community for up to a year, being cared for by the elder women. The girls were taught songs and word games, as well as sexual manners. They also embroidered the leather capes, with which they had entered seclusion, with their own individual beadwork designs, thus turning them into elaborately decorated skirts like the ones on display that demonstrated their skill and dexterity. The girls were also circumcised. For the Iraqw, circumcision was a rite of purification, performed so that when the girls emerged from seclusion – wearing their colourful skirts – they were considered to be reborn with a new innocence and dignity, ready for married life.
As a result of a political struggle between the leader of the ritual specialists and Michael Ahho, a chief appointed by the British colonial authorities who was also a Christian, Marmo was banned in the 1930s. Despite the enormous political, economic and cultural changes that have affected Tanzanian society up to and beyond indepence in 1961, it appears that the ritual may have continued to be practised into the 1970s at least. Moreover, it appears that some elements of Marmo, including the singing of the songs at ceremonies and the making and wearing of beaded skirts, have been maintained by Iraqw women to the present day.
Campaigners against female genital mutilation (FGM) have argued that circumcision is a violation of women’s rights, particularly where it is practised on young girls. Such campaigners have had only limited success in eastern Africa, however, where circumcision is still widely practised amongst many groups, including the Iraqw, for whom the custom has profound cultural and social importance.",,,"Jeremy Coote, Hadiqa Khan, Elizabeth Porter",https://prm.web.ox.ac.uk/event/tradition-continued,national crafts,"leather, beads",clothing,offline,TRUE

Purchasers would then make their own arrangements as to how the books were bound. In this case, the printed text includes a ‘List of the Plates’ that provides ‘directions for placing them’ in the correct position in the text.
Not all surviving copies of the Voyage contain all the plates, while some surviving sets of plates have been bound separately. For example, in the University’s Bodleian Library are two copies of the first edition of the Voyage: one with a complete set of plates that have been bound in, more or less exactly according to the ‘directions’; the other with no plates at all. Also in the Bodleian there is an incomplete set of plates, separately bound.
The Voyage and the Artist
On his second famous voyage of exploration, Cook sailed to the Pacific in HMS Resolution, accompanied by its consort HMS Adventure, commanded by Tobias Furneaux. Cook had been instructed by the Admiralty to establish whether or not there is a great continent in the south seas. As well as carrying out three exploratory cruises through the Antarctic Ocean, Cook visited the Society Islands (including Tahiti), Tonga, the Marquesas Islands, Rapa Nui (Easter Island), New Caledonia, Vanuatu, New Zealand, and Tierra del Fuego.
Among those who sailed with Cook were the Prussian-born Johann Reinhold Forster (1729–1798) and his son Johann George Adam (1754–1794) who had been appointed ‘at the King’s pleasure’ naturalists to the expedition. The Forsters made large collections of botanical and zoological specimens, as well as collections of Pacific art and artefacts. In 1776 they gave an important collection of such ‘artificial curiosities’ acquired on the voyage to the University of Oxford. Many of the objects they donated are on permanent display at the east end of the Pitt Rivers Museum’s Lower Gallery.
The London-born landscape painter William Hodges (1744–1797) was appointed as the voyage artist. He produced numerous sketches, drawings, and paintings in chalk, charcoal, watercolour, and oil during the voyage. Afterwards, he was employed by the Admiralty to work up some of his sketches into large oil paintings. He was also commissioned to supervise the production of engravings based on his sketches and drawings for publication in the official account of the voyage.
The Portraits
Each of the prints displayed here is derived from a portrait that was drawn in red chalk during the voyage by the official artist William Hodges. The original drawings (fifteen of which survive) are remarkable for the way in which they appear to capture both the likeness and the character of the person portrayed. Although serving to give the book’s readers an idea of the general appearance of the different peoples of the Pacific, they are individual portraits rather than types.
In order to have the prints ready quickly, a number of artists were employed to engrave the portraits on to copper plates for printing. Five of the engravings were by John Hall (1739–1797), four by James Caldwall (1739–1822), three by James Basire (1730–1802), two by John Keyes Sherwin (1751–1790), one each by François Germain Aliamet (1726–1788), Francesco Bartolozzi (1727–1816), and John-Baptiste Michel (1748–1804), while one was anonymous. All the engravers were skilled artists with their own styles that affected how Hodges’ original drawings were translated into a different medium.
At the time Basire was working on the three engravings that bear his name, one of his apprentices was the famous artist and poet William Blake (1757–1827). It has been suggested that Blake’s particular skills and sympathies can be seen in the portraits entitled ‘Man of the Island of Tanna’ and ‘Woman of the Island of Tanna’.
Provenance
The eighteen plates are part of a complete set that came to the Museum from the collection of Harry Geoffrey Beasley (1882–1939). Beasley was a wealthy businessman who had a particular interest in Pacific art, displaying his collection at his private Cranmore Ethnographic Museum in Chislehurst in Kent. The Cranmore Museum closed following Beasley’s death in 1939 and bomb damage sustained in 1942. In the mid-1940s his widow Irene Marguerite (who died 1974) donated a large collection of books of travel and exploration to the Balfour Library at the Pitt Rivers Museum. The set of plates may have been donated then, or with a later donation of objects in 1955.
It is not known whether Beasley acquired the plates as a set or acquired them piecemeal from different sources at different times. It does appear, however, that all the plates come from one or more bound copies of the Voyage. Many editions of the Voyage were published in London and Dublin in 1777, 1778, and in subsequent years. It is not possible to tell for which edition these plates were printed.",,,"Leverhulme Trust, Sophia Martin-Pavlou, Emma McKinlay and Rosemary Turner",https://prm.web.ox.ac.uk/event/variety-of-portraits-of-persons,visual art,"paper, graphite",communication,offline,TRUE
20,GB,PR,exhibition,17 Dec 2019,3 May 2020,2019,2020,West Africa,Guinea-Bissau,Blow-Up in Bissau,Photography and Museum Revival in West Africa,,"The National Ethnographic Museum of Guinea-Bissau, which opened in 1988, once housed a unique collection of objects from different cultural groups in West Africa, with photographs displayed alongside showing them being used or worn. During the civil war of 1998–9 the Museum was occupied by Senegalese troops who had joined government forces, resulting in damage and loss to the Museum and its collections.
However not everything was destroyed; 450 sheets of contact prints did survive, documenting the collections that the Museum once housed in the country’s capital Bissau, and the ethnographic work its staff undertook during the 1980s in order to found their museum. The contact prints, so called for the way they are developed directly from negatives, have been revisited, digitised, enlarged (‘blown-up’) and reproduced here to tell the story of the Museum and its history. Working with Museum Director Dr Albano Mendes, it was possible to reconstruct the early history of the Museum and create an exhibition in Bissau in 2017.
The contact prints that survived depict the Museum’s various interests and past displays, photographs of its objects, fieldwork photographs showing objects being used, as well as members of local communities. Thematic displays included local architecture, arts and craft, performances, and food production. Developed as quick reference prints, many of the contact print sheets are worn and punched with holes for filing. Connections between the small rows of images can be seen on closer inspection, helping to weave together the Museum’s history.
The National Ethnographic Museum (founded 1988) was relocated in 2010, rehousing the objects and records that had survived the civil war. The Museum’s new building used to house the old Museum of Portuguese Guinea (1946–1974) that had been set up in colonial times. With a new home, new displays could be organized, although this took some time. In September 2017 an exhibition using blown-up images from the contact prints and surviving objects was finally created in the Museum, to tell its past and signal a future.
Working with the Museum team, the curators of this exhibition selected contact print images to be reprinted in graphic displays. Images were organized thematically (weaving, livelihoods, religion, historical places, games, etc.) with texts for each theme, on thirteen roll-up banners, and with objects displayed on plinths nearby. Among the many visitors who came on the day of the opening, 15 September 2017, was the Minister of Culture, who promised financial support for the Museum. 
The exhibition was reviewed by the media as the revival of the Museum, and ever since that day the Museum remains open daily to the public, with schools and universities visiting it regularly. The roll-ups with the reconstructed images played the same role as the images on the walls of the lost Museum, reviving the important work that the Museum once did in documenting and celebrating the remarkable cultures of Guinea-Bissau.",,,"National Ethnographic Museum of Guinea-Bissau, Malcolm McLeod, Roger Canals, National TV of Guinea-Bissau",https://prm.web.ox.ac.uk/event/blow-up-in-bissau,visual art,paper,communication,offline,TRUE

Two hundred artefacts and photographs from the Museum’s historic collections were shown alongside 23 new artworks by Indigenous and Adivasi artists from across India, commissioned and purchased with support of a New Collecting Award from Art Fund.
Focusing on communities known variously as Indigenous, ‘Tribal’ or Adivasi (literally ‘original inhabitants’), the exhibition showcases extraordinary and fascinating objects, many of which tell equally intriguing stories. From the Nagas and other peoples in the hills of Northeast India to the Gonds, Todas and Chenchus of the South and the  Santals and Bhils in the East and West of the country, the displays will present strikingly diverse stories of India, collecting, colonialism and British involvement in the subcontinent.
Some of these stories offer different perspectives on histories that are well known. Others deal with less well-known, and sometimes difficult, moments in the shared history of India and the UK. All present versions of India very different from that familiar to most people in Britain – and perhaps in India too.
Another India is the centrepiece of the University’s India Unboxed season. To mark the UK-India Year of Culture 2017, the University of Cambridge Museums and Botanic Garden, are hosting a shared season on the theme of India with a programme of exhibitions, events, digital encounters, discussions, installations and more within the museums and the city of Cambridge. Rooted in the Cambridge collections, the programme will explore themes of identity and connectivity for audiences in both the UK and India.

24,GB,MAA,exhibition,13 Jun 2017 ,10 Sep 2017,2017,2017,South Africa,South Africa,Kholwa: The Longing of Belonging,"Photographs of Zionist Christians in contemporary South Africa, by Sabelo Mlangeni",,"This exhibition of photographs by the South African photographer, Sabelo Mlangeni, portrays Zionist Christians in contemporary South Africa. Zionism (unrelated to Jewish Zionism) is the country’s largest popular religious movement  – approximately 30% of all South Africans are members of a Zionist church.
While Mlangeni has photographed Zionists since 1997, the idea of an exhibition dedicated to the topic crystallized during the course of his conversations throughout 2016 with Joel Cabrita, an academic at the University of Cambridge Faculty of Divinity who is researching the history of Zionism in South Africa.
Mlangeni is himself a member of a Zionist church and his own trace in these intimate, personal portraits of church members is subtly felt. Boundaries between observer and subject are continually erased and broken down. Mlangeni is portraying his own belief as much as he is exploring the spiritual commitments of his photographic subjects.
Sabelo Mlangeni is a photographer based in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he moved in 2001. Mlangeni joined the Market Photo Workshop in this year, and graduated from it in 2004. His most recent solo exhibition was in Auckland, New Zealand at the Artspace (‘Heartbreaker’). He has also recently had a solo show with the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna entitled ‘Postapart/heid Communities’ in 2014. Mlangeni’s work has been exhibited in notable group exhibitions, including Public Intimacy: Art and Social Life in South Africa at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco (2014); Apartheid and After at Huis Marseille, Amsterdam (2014); Rise and Fall of Apartheid: Photography and the Bureaucracy of Everyday Life, Haus der Kunst, Munich (2013); Figures and Fictions: Contemporary South African photography at the V&A Museum, London (2011); and I am not afraid: The Market Photo Workshop, Johannesburg, Johannesburg Art Gallery (2010). Mlangeni has been the recipient of several international prizes, including the Tollman Award for the Visual Arts in 2009 and the POPCAP Piclet Prize for African Photography in 2016.
Working mainly in a black and white format, Mlangeni’s photographs have focused on capturing the intimate, everyday moments of communities in contemporary South Africa. His work includes ‘Big City’ (2002 to 2015) which focuses on Johannesburg’s history, and ‘Country Girls’ (shot between 2003 and 2009), which focuses on gay communities in rural South Africa, especially in the area of Driefontein, his own village in the province of Mpumalanga. Personally knowing many of his photographic subjects as childhood friends means that Mlangeni has been able to create photographs from a perspective of unique understanding and membership of the community he is portraying. Throughout his work, Mlangeni avoids ‘othering’ or ‘exoticizing’ his subjects, and instead attempts to show the multi-faceted, intimate reality of daily life of these individuals. While many of them face discrimination due to their sexual identities, Mlangeni’s work does not cast them as ‘victims’ but rather portrays their resilience, joyfulness and dignity as ordinary people.

Many of the artists responsible talk about their work as a form of storytelling, and the stories they tell relate to the lives of their ancestors, hunting and gathering, but also their lives today, living on a former mission with limited access to the land and the resources it once supplied. The exhibition will juxtapose black and white images of San people in Botswana during the 1930s from the museum’s collections, with the colourful images produced more recently at the Kuru Art Project.
This art workshop, established in 1990 at D’Kar in western Botswana, was inspired by the ancient tradition of San rock art found across southern Africa. While many of the images have similarities to the rock art tradition, others feature beads and beadwork, another ancient tradition of artistic practice associated with San people. Archaeological finds have suggested that people in Botswana made beads from ostrich eggshell before our species, Homo Sapiens, arrived in Europe, and the exhibition explores the connections between beadwork and painting as artistic practices.

Baron Anatole von Hügel, MAA’s first curator, travelled within Fiji between 1874 and 1877, a period coinciding with Fiji’s entry into the British Empire. Along with Sir Arthur Gordon (First Governor of Fiji) and Alfred Percival Maudslay (Sir Arthur’s private secretary), von Hügel assembled an impressive Fijian collection, including outstanding objects presented by Fijian and Tongan chiefs. This material formed the founding ethnographic collection of the Museum when it opened in 1884. The opening of this exhibition in June 2013 marks the centenary of the Museum moving to its current building on Downing Street.

Exceptional barkcloths, rarely displayed, will be featured including two works by women of the Omie community of Papua New Guinea, acquired in 2012 with the support of the Art Fund and other donors.
For millennia, Pacific Islanders have made cloth from the bark of trees. Often taking on ceremonial significance, its decoration is extraordinary, with patterns that are enjoyed for their abstraction as much as their symbolism. Today, the practice of barkcloth- making remains a vital aspect of many Pacific Island communities. Barkcloth is made by soaking and beating the inner bark of specific trees, most commonly the Paper Mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera). In some places it takes the form of huge sheets featuring optically dynamic patterns, while elsewhere barkcloth features plants and animal life, sacred creatures and mythic narratives. Some cloths were wealth objects, spectacular fabrics many metres in size, which were presented by one clan to another on great ceremonial occasions. Cloth was often understood as a kind of skin, a powerful wrapping for the body which revealed its inner state and identity. Primarily created by women using inherited clan designs, the manufacture of barkcloth formed a major vehicle for both creative expression and social cohesion, maintaining and communicating the artists’ deep connection to their ancestors and country.

We have been coming through Covid and the end of the Queen Elizabethan age towards a possible new dawn, a reset and new beginnings.
Belenguer says about his PostColonial Masterpieces series:
We live in a transitional era where the traditional powers are being distributed and relegated from Europe and North America to the emerging economies in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Where the established transport, hospitality, banking and financial sector see their share of services being taken away by the new technologies and the sharing economy. Belenguer attempts to reflect this requestioning and changes with the rework of prints of traditional European paintings by Constable, Whistler, Murillo and other painters of Pastoral scenes and resets them in a postcolonial era.
Belenguer is like a hunter who trawls the city for found objects and images loaded with symbolism to construct new narratives. The past emerges into a new future; unopened and enigmatic. He investigates the use of symbols that imposes and reinforces hierarchies in the social strata, its effectiveness in the subconsciousness of the collective, and the political propaganda in the propagation of fear to the enemy and the social classes.
However, the traditional hierarchization of the elites controlling the masses within those territories shall become obsolete in the era of neo-technological empires, social media, AI, big data and connected smartphones.
Bookery Gallerie is an emporium bookshop and a new creative venture in Church Street, Lisson Grove, London. It is situated in the heart of a parade of established antique shops and is right opposite the world famous Alfie's Antiques Market. It will present a programme of established and emerging artists from far and wide and also very much encourage and include local and international artists. Bookery Gallerie has evolved out of a book soiree night which brought together an eclectic range of personalities including many artists, writers, musicians, thinkers, film makers and more, over a period of more than two years.
Lorenzo Belenguer is a nonbinary visual artist and arts writer based in London and Valencia strongly influenced by Minimalism and Arte Povera.
Belenguer's practice as an artist is constantly focused on the reclaiming: be it objects like discarded rusted metal into the gallery spaces and copies of traditional European paintings as symbols of imperial power. Also into the reclaiming of the place of humans into the natural ecosystem as ancient cultures perfectly knew. He is a member of the Gallery Climate Coalition. Previously, Belenguer ran a community art gallery In London for seven years and a project for London 2012 called Testimonies. He supports the power of the Arts to communicate ways to move into a more compassionate and loving society as we are witnessing in the current pandemic.
He exhibited and performed at The Serpentine Galleries, TATE Modern and at the 57th Venice Biennale. The UCL Art Historian Susie Hodge included him as a representative of the Neo-Geometric Conceptualism (Neo-Geo) Movement alongside Jeff Koons and Ashley Bickerton in her latest book. Belenguer's works have been featured in the national media in Spain, Germany, Italy and the UK such as The Independent, The Guardian, The Telegraph, Artforum and The Art Newspaper.
Belenguer holds an MA in Artificial Intelligence & Philosophy by the New College of the Humanities in London, and a BA (Hons) in Economics and Business Science by the University of Valencia, Spain.",,,,https://www.artrabbit.com/events/postcolonial-masterpieces-at-these-momentous-times-group-show,visual art,"paper, paints, graphite",artistic expression,offline,TRUE

These thousands of objects, many due to indigenous or mestizo artists, often present materials, themes and techniques unknown in the metropolis, and their realization responded to various purposes: reaffirmation of the dominance of the metropolis, identity aspirations of the Creole elites, or documentary, devotional and aesthetic motivations.

Several belonged to the old royal collection and hung in the same palaces where the canvases of Rubens or Velázquez did; however, the Prado Museum has ignored this reality until now.

Estos miles de objetos, muchos debidos a artífices indígenas o mestizos, presentan a menudo materiales, temas y técnicas desconocidos en la metrópoli, y su realización respondió a propósitos diversos: reafirmación del dominio de la metrópoli, aspiraciones identitarias de las elites criollas, o motivaciones documentales, devocionales y estéticas.

Almost 20% of them died on the way, and those who survived faced very harsh living conditions, deprived of liberty and treated as a possession in the Spanish, Portuguese, English, French and Dutch colonies.

There were not a few uprisings of people subjected to this deprivation of rights. The first one in 1522 on the island of Hispaniola (Dominican Republic and Haiti). Many enslaved people managed to flee. Known as cimarrones, some came to create communities far from the colonial power, called quilombos and palenques, where they could be free and helped other enslaved people, such as the Quilombo dos Palmares in Brazil (1580-1710) or San Basilio de Palenque in Colombia. The latter persists today, as well as its culture and its language, Palenquero. Other forms of resistance to slavery were music, dance or religion. Thus, African-American religions emerged, in which African, indigenous and Christian elements merged, such as Santeria, candomblé or voodoo.","Entre los siglos XVI y XIX, unos 12 millones de personas fueron desplazadas forzosamente desde su hogar en África para trabajar como mano de obra esclava en América, o Abya Yala, el nombre que el pueblo guna da al continente.
