## What is it about?
Although the question of cultural representation is studied by various scholars, little has been done to investigate the status of cultures of postcolonial countries in former main colonial “motherlands” from an institutional point of view. This study focuses on the analysis of the cultural representation of Latin-American, African and Asian ethnicities in significant British and Spanish museums such as the British Museum, Pitt Rivers Museum, Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Museo de Reina Sofia, Museo del Prado, Museo de América. The paper contributes to a modern view of socio-cultural studies using social network analysis to highlight main contributors and statistical methods to identify patterns and trends significant for the representation of investigated cultures at exhibitions of sampled museums. 

## About data
The data used in the project was collected and annotated by the participants themselves. The initial data included information about exhibitions posted on the official websites of the British Museum, Pitt Rivers Museum, Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Museo de Reina Sofía, Museo del Prado, Museo de América. Information was gathered on 67 exhibitions held from 2013 to 2023. The resulting research data is compiled in the table "Dataset of the project - exhibitions.csv". In the future, this can be used in research as a historical source of cultural interaction.

Keywords: cultural representation, post-colonial digital humanities, social network analysis, british museums, spanish museums, latino cultures, african cultures, asian cultures, cultural objects.
