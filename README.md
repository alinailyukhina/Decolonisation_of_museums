## What is it about?
Although the question of cultural representation is studied by various scholars, little has been done to investigate the status of cultures of postcolonial countries in former main colonial “motherlands” from an institutional point of view. This study focuses on the analysis of the cultural representation of Latin-American, African and Asian ethnicities in significant British and Spanish museums such as the British Museum, Pitt Rivers Museum, Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Museo de Reina Sofia, Museo del Prado, Museo de América. The paper contributes to a modern view of socio-cultural studies using social network analysis to highlight main contributors and statistical methods to identify patterns and trends significant for the representation of investigated cultures at exhibitions of sampled museums.
